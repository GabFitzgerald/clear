# Clear

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anykeyh/clear.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anykeyh/clear) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-available-brightgreen.svg)](https://anykeyh.github.io/clear/) [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/anykeyh/clear.svg)](https://github.com/anykeyh/clear/releases)

Clear is an ORM built specifically for PostgreSQL in Crystal.

It's probably the most advanced ORM for PG on Crystal in term of features offered.
It features Active Record pattern models, and low-level SQL builder.

You can deal out of the box with jsonb, tsvectors, cursors, CTE, bcrypt password,
array, uuid primary key, foreign constraints... and other things !
It also has a powerful DSL to construct `where` and `having` clauses.

The philosophy beneath is to please me (and you !) with emphasis made on business
code readability and minimal setup.

It is in active development and actively maintained !
